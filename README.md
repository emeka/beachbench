BeachBench
==========

A benchmarking library and tool ported from Peter Veentjer's Benchy (https://github.com/pveentjer/Benchy)
removing the Groovy code.

The Groovy commands will be replace by Maven plugin mojos.

**Warning**
This library is totally superseeded by [Google Caliper](https://code.google.com/p/caliper/) which goes far beyond Benchy and thus BeachBench in its
handling of microbenchmarking.
